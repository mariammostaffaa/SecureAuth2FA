🔒 Secure Flask Login with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
This project provides a Flask-based authentication system with 2FA (TOTP) support. Users log in with a username & password, then verify with a TOTP code generated by an authenticator app.

🚀 Features
✅ User Authentication (Username & Password)
✅ Secure Password Hashing (bcrypt)
✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (TOTP)
✅ QR Code Generation for 2FA Setup
✅ Compatible with Mobile & Desktop Authenticators
✅ Flask Backend with SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL

📌 How It Works
1️⃣ User enters their username & password.
2️⃣ If credentials are correct, the app generates a QR code.
3️⃣ The user scans the QR code using an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
4️⃣ The app provides a 6-digit OTP code every 30 seconds.
5️⃣ User enters the OTP code to complete the login process.
